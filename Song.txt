I'd rather be kissing in summer, so innocent
In your apartment on the weekends
Lift up my dress to see where you've been
That's what I want and that's where I am
Bite off an apple right from your fridge
Come here and taste it right off my lips
Spill your emotions into my hands
That's what I want
